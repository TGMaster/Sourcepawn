  L4D2 (+ L4D1) pouncedamage+ [Hunter]
  `````````````````````````````````

	This plugin allows you to:
		
		+ Uncap hunter pounce damage upto any value you require (including fully uncapped [400+]), pounce 
		  damage will scale as normal upto the inbuilt cap (i.e. a 25dmg pounce before adding the plugin will
		  STILL be a 25 dmg pounce afterwards) but pounce damage will continue to increase (using the same 
		  default scaling) beyond the inbuilt cap, upto the limit decided by pdplus_maxdmg.  (Default 100)

		+ Adjust damage scaling so that pounce damage NO LONGER scales at the default amount, allowing
		  the distance required to acheieve a given pounce damage to be increased (by reducing the damage scaling 
		  value) or decreased (by increasing the damage scaling value).  The damage scaling factor (pdplus_scale) 
		  acts as a multiplier to the damage inflicted by a pounce, so turning it up (> 1) increases the damage for 
		  a given pounce while turning it down (0 < x < 1) decreases the damage dealt. (Default 1.0 = default scaling)
		+ Enable pounce damage 'carry-over' on incap; essentially, if a survivor is incapped by pounce damage
		  but did not have sufficient health before being incapped to experience all of the pounce damage acheived 
		  by the hunter, then any 'lost' damage will be applied once the survivor is downed. i.e. a 45 dmg pounce on 
		  a survivor with only 10 hp would normally lose 35 hp of hard-earned damage, with pdplus_incap_dmg set to 1
		  however, this extra damage will be taken from the survivors 300 incapped-hp, leaving them downed with 265 hp.
		  (Default 1 = carry-over enabled)

		+ If incap pounce damage carry-over IS enabled, then you can also scale the dmg that is applied POST-incap using 
		  the pdplus_incap_scale cvar.  Any damage dealt to an incapped survivor due to the damage carry-over system 
		  will be multiplied by this value before it is applied.  i.e. if pdplus_incap_scale was set to 3 in the above 
		  example, then the 35 hp of 'carry-over' damage would be multiplied by 3 to give 105 hp of dmg to be carried 
		  over into the survivor's incapped hp (leaving them incapped with 195 hp). (Default 1.0 = no rescaling of incap dmg)

		+ There is also an inbuilt notifications system to inform players of what the plugin is doing, this also includes
		  several cvars to customise which notifications are displayed and how they are displayed: pdplus_notify to enable
		  or disable notifications (0) & select notification style (1 - chat msg, over default cap dmg only; 2 - chat msg, all 
		  damage pounces over pdplus_notify_min; 3 - hintbox, over default cap dmg only; 4 - hintbox, all damage pounces over 
		  pdplus_notify_min); pdplus_notify_all to toggle between notifications being sent to all players (1) or just to the 
		  pounce damage attacker & victim (0); pdplus_welcome to enable (1)/disable (0) a chat message explaining the effects
		  of pdplus to connecting players; pdplus_incapnotify to toggle notifications when a player receives incap carry-over 
		  damage (0 - off; 1 - on).


	The plugin also includes a hunter pounce stats system which collects info on players' total # of pounces, total # of
	damage pounces, total pounce damage dealt, total # of incap-dmg causing pounces, total incap damage dealt and also each player's
	highest damage pounce score on the server to date (their pounce damage p.b.).

	Users may check their stats and the top <n> highest dmg pounces on the server using chat or console commands 
	(!pdpstats [sm_pdpstats / pdplus_mystats] & !pdptop <n> [sm_pdptop <n>] respectively).
